# Analog series generation and analysis

Complete set of scripts for producing analog series when running any .py, the "scripts" folder must be within the same folder as the .py, just as found here. 

For the  big-data-VS.py you will also need an "input" folder with the queries processed with get-cores.py, and a "ZINC-frags" folder with the processed ZINC database.
