README

In this folder, all files and data required to get 
analog series from ZINC are present.

First, from ZINC database, a downloader-txt.uri file
with a list of repositories was obtained, which is used
by ZINCget.sh. Then, all of the following is sequentially run in
"big-data-cores.ipynb" or "big-data-cores.py":

- Preprocess and wash molecules
- Get unique
- Split in files of maximum 1M molecules
- Fragment every file

Once the database is ready, "big-data-VS.ipynb" and "big-data-VS.py"
run a virtual screening of analogs in the created output files:
- Perform VS on every file given an input
- Get hit files
- Process hit files to R group tables
